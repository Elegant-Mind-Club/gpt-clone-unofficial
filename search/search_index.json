Define Your Plugin Class: Define a class for your plugin that extends the <code>Tool</code> class. Set the <code>name</code> and <code>description</code> properties in the constructor. If your plugin requires credentials or other variables, set them from the fields parameter or from a method that retrieves them from your process environment. Note: if your plugin requires long, detailed instructions, you can add a <code>description_for_model</code> property and make <code>description</code> more general.</p> <p>3. Define Helper Methods: Define helper methods within your class to handle specific tasks if needed.</p> <p>4. Implement the <code>_call</code> Method: Implement the <code>_call</code> method where the main functionality of your plugin is defined. This method is called when the language model decides to use your plugin. It should take an <code>input</code> parameter and return a result. If an error occurs, the function should return a string representing an error, rather than throwing an error. If your plugin requires multiple inputs from the LLM, read the StructuredTools section.</p> <p>5. Export Your Plugin and Import into handleTools.js: Export your plugin and import it into <code>handleTools.js</code>. Add your plugin to the <code>toolConstructors</code> object in the <code>loadTools</code> function. If your plugin requires more advanced initialization, add it to the <code>customConstructors</code> object.</p> <p>6. Export YourPlugin into index.js: Export your plugin into <code>index.js</code> under <code>tools</code>. Add your plugin to the <code>module.exports</code> of the <code>index.js</code>, so you also need to declare it as <code>const</code> in this file.</p> <p>7. Add Your Plugin to manifest.json: Add your plugin to <code>manifest.json</code>. Follow the strict format for each of the fields of the \"plugin\" object.

The <code>pluginKey</code> should match the class <code>name</code> of the Tool class you made, and the <code>authField</code> prop must match the process.env variable name.</p> <p>Remember, the key to creating a custom plugin is to extend the <code>Tool</code> class and implement the <code>_call</code> method.

During the end of that time, I had most of the UI and basic functionality done. This was created without using any boilerplates or templates, including create-react-app and other toolchains.

It uses a scoring mechanism to track user violations. As users commit actions like excessive logins, registrations, or messaging, they accumulate violation scores. Upon reaching a set threshold, the user and their IP are temporarily banned. This system ensures platform security by monitoring and penalizing rapid or suspicious activities.</p> <p>To set up the mod system, review the setup guide.</p> <p>Please Note: If you want this to work in development mode, you will need to create a file called <code>.env.development</code> in the root directory and set <code>DOMAIN_CLIENT</code> to <code>http://localhost:3090</code> or whatever port  is provided by vite when runnning <code>npm run frontend-dev</code></p>"},{"location":"install/configuration/user_auth_system.html#email-and-password-reset","title":"Email and Password Reset","text":""},{"location":"install/configuration/user_auth_system.html#general-setup","title":"General setup","text":"<p>in the .env file modify these variables:</p> <pre><code>EMAIL_SERVICE=                  # eg. gmail - see https://community.nodemailer.com/2-0-0-beta/setup-smtp/well-known-services/\nEMAIL_HOST=                     # eg. example.com - if EMAIL_SERVICE is not set, connect to this server.\nEMAIL_PORT=25                   # eg. 25 - mail server port to connect to with EMAIL_HOST (usually 25, 465, 587)\nEMAIL_ENCRYPTION=               # eg. starttls - valid values: starttls (force STARTTLS), tls (obligatory TLS), anything else (use STARTTLS if available)\nEMAIL_ENCRYPTION_HOSTNAME=      # eg. example.com - check the name in the certificate against this instead of EMAIL_HOST\nEMAIL_ALLOW_SELFSIGNED=         # eg. true - valid values: true (allow self-signed), anything else (disallow self-signed)\nEMAIL_USERNAME=                 # eg. me@gmail.com - the username used for authentication.

LibreChat - the human-readable address in the From is constructed as \"EMAIL_FROM_NAME &lt;EMAIL_FROM&gt;\". Defaults to APP_TITLE.\n</code></pre> <p>If you want to use one of the predefined services, configure only these variables:</p> <p>EMAIL_SERVICE is the name of the email service you are using (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo Mail, ProtonMail, iCloud Mail, etc.) as defined in the NodeMailer well-known services linked above. EMAIL_USERNAME is the username of the email service (usually, it will be the email address, but in some cases, it can be an actual username used to access the account). EMAIL_PASSWORD is the password used to access the email service. This is not the password to access the email account directly, but a password specifically generated for this service. EMAIL_FROM is the email address that will appear in the \"from\" field when a user receives an email. EMAIL_FROM_NAME is the name that will appear in the \"from\" field when a user receives an email. If left unset, it defaults to the app title.</p> <p>If you want to use a generic SMTP service or need advanced configuration for one of the predefined providers, configure these variables:</p> <p>EMAIL_HOST is the hostname to connect to, or an IP address. EMAIL_PORT is the port to connect to. Be aware that different ports usually come with different requirements - 25 is for mailserver-to-mailserver, 465 requires encryption at the start of the connection, and 587 allows submission of mail as a user. EMAIL_ENCRYPTION defines if encryption is required at the start (<code>tls</code>) or started after the connection is set up (<code>starttls</code>). If either of these values are set, they are enforced. If they are not set, an encrypted connection is started if available. EMAIL_ENCRYPTION_HOSTNAME allows specification of a hostname against which the certificate is validated. Use this if the mail server does have a valid certificate, but you are connecting with an IP or a different name for some reason. EMAIL_ALLOW_SELFSIGNED defines whether self-signed certificates can be accepted from the server. As the mails being sent contain sensitive information, ONLY use this for testing.</p> <p>NOTE: \u26a0\ufe0f Failing to perform either of the below setups will result in LibreChat using the unsecured password reset! This allows anyone to reset any password on your server immediately, without mail being sent at all! The variable EMAIL_FROM does not support all email providers but is still required.

This means services will load on boot, but also means managing these containers is a little more manual and requires interacting with systemd instead of podman directly.</p> <p>For instance, instead of <code>podman stop {name}</code>, you would instead do <code>systemctl --user stop container-{name}</code> to perform maintenance (such as updates or backups). Likewise, if you need to start the service again you simply can run <code>systemctl --user start container-{name}</code>.
